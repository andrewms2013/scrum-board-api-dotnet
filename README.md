# scrum-board-api-dotnet
Project I did in order to refresh my knowledge of API building and get proficient with ASP.Net Core APIs from scratch.

The API consists of 3 controllers: Authentication, CRUD for workspaces and CRUD for tasks.

The project uses PostgreSQL as database. Uses Swagger, API versioning and Server level caching.
